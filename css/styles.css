/* we kept on running into an issue where there would be a horizontal scrollbar, which, for this device, is just
totally unnecessary. to get round this, see the html and body styles - this sets the width and height to 100% of
the viewport (strictly speaking, you should use vw and vh, but % works better) and box-sizing makes sure that
any padding or border sizes are included in said 100%, rather than excluded, which leads to a horizontal scrollbar.
the margin property (margin: 0px auto;) of body can also help to get rid of the scrollbar. */
